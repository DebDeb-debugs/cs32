3/2 4:15 pm:  If you've been having sporadic failures reporting that a star
moved incorrectly, download and use this (hopefully final)
<a href="p3sanity.zip">revision of the sanity checker</a>, which is driving us
insane.
</p><p>
3/2 4:30 am:  The issues with the sanity checker sporadically (about one in 30
times) reporting a failure have been fixed.  Download and use
<a href="p3sanity.zip">this version</a>.
</p><p>
3/1 5:45 pm:  Here is our <a href="p3sanity.zip">sanity checker for Part 2</a>
that <strong>must build without errors</strong> under g32.  If it does not
also run without errors, then either you have some fundamental problem that
may cost you a lot of points or you haven't properly implemented shooting
projectiles or collision detection.  Download the zip file (p3sanity.zip),
add your four files to it, then transfer it to cs32.seas.ucla.edu as the
<a href="../../linux.html">g++ with Linux</a> writeup tells you.  Log into
the Linux server, and unzip that zip file, which will create a directory
named p3sanity.  Change directories into that directory and type the
commands
</p>
<pre>
	make
	./p3sanity
</pre>
<p>
You can read the code in p3sanity.cpp to see what it does:  It creates a
StudentWorld, calls init, checks for 30 stars and a Nachenblaster, calls move
(simulating the user typing the right arrow), checks that the stars moved
left and the NachenBlaster moved right and an alien was created, calls move
again (simulating the user typing a space), checks that a cabbage and another
alien were created, calls move again, checks that the cabbage moved and
rotated, teleports an alien to within collision range of the cabbage (by
forcibly calling moveTo on it with those coordinates), calls move again, checks
that the cabbage is now gone, calls cleanUp, and destroys the StudentWorld.
If the last thing written is a SUCCESS message, your program passed the sanity
check.
</p>
2/22 1:35 am:  If the sanity checker is failing in your StudentWorld
destructor, chances are your destructor is calling cleanUp (which it ought
to) when an earlier call to cleanUp did not leave the StudentWorld object in
a state where cleanUp could be called again (e.g., the object has some
dangling pointers that would be disastrous to use in delete expressions).
</p><p>
2/22 1:15 am:  If you downloaded the Windows skeleton before 2/22 1:15 am,
please replace three files with these versions:
<a href="GraphObject.h">GraphObject.h</a>, 
<a href="SpriteManager.h">SpriteManager.h</a>, and
<a href="GameController.cpp">GameController.cpp</a>.
</p><p>
2/21 11:45 pm:  The spec says  on p. 49 for what to turn in for Part #1
<em>We may also devise a simple test framework that runs under g32; if we
do, your code must build without errors in that framework. If it does not
also run without errors, that indicates some fundamental problem that will
probably cost you a lot of points.</em>  Here is that test framework that
<strong>must build without errors</strong>, our
<a href="oldp3sanity.zip">Project 3 sanity checker</a>.  Download that zip file
(p3sanity.zip), add your four files to it, then transfer it to
cs32.seas.ucla.edu as the <a href="../../linux.html">g++ with Linux</a>
writeup tells you.  Log into the Linux server, and unzip that zip file,
which will create a directory named p3sanity.  Change directories into that
directory and type the commands
</p>
<pre>
	make
	./p3sanity
</pre>
<p>
This creates a StudentWorld, calls init, calls move once (simulating the user
typing the up arrow key), call cleanUp, and destroys the StudentWorld.
The sanity check is passed if init creates 30 stars and a Nachenblaster,
move moves the stars to the left by one pixel and the Nachenblaster up six
pixels, cleanUp deletes all actors in the game, and execution of the program
does not cause a runtime crash.  (The test does not check for an alien being
created by the call to move, or anything else other than what's required for
Part #1.)  If the test is passed, a SUCCESS message is the last thing written.
</p><p>
2/20 9:00 AM:  We are addressing the abrupt visual effect of objects like
stars disappearing on the left rather abruptly.  It will be a simple
change, affecting you only by changing a couple of numeric constants.
More to come when we work out the details.
</p><p>
2/19 12:20 PM:  For each type of goodie, the list of what it must do during
each tick was updated to add a step to check if it has flown off the screen.
</p><p>
To see what the game looks like in action:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Windows:  Open <a href="NachenBlaster-sample-windows.zip">the Windows sample
executable zip file</a> and drag the folder named NachenBlaster in it to
your desktop.  In that desktop folder, double-click on the NachenBlaster
application.  On the SEASnet Windows server, you may have to move the folder
to C:\Users\<em>yourusername</em> instead of the desktop.
</li><li>
macOS:  You'll need to have XQuartz and freeGLUT installed to run the
program.
<ol>
<li>
Install <a href="http://xquartz.org/" target="_blank">XQuartz</a>:
<ol type="a">
<li>
Click the download link, open the downloaded .dmg file, double-click on
XQuartz.pkg, and follow the installation instructions.
</li><li>
Log out and log back in again.
</li><li>
To verify the installation, open a Terminal window and run the command
<code>echo $DISPLAY</code>.  That should produce one line of output that
ends with <code>org.macosforge.xquartz:0</code>.
</li>
</ol>
</li><li>
Install freeGLUT:
<ol type="a">
<li>
Install the <a href="http://brew.sh/" target="_blank">homebrew</a> package
manager.
</li><li>
Open a Terminal window and run the command <code>brew install freeglut</code>.
</li>
</ol>
</li><li>
Unzip <a href="NachenBlaster-sample-mac.zip">the Mac sample executable zip
file</a>.  In that zip file is a file named README.txt that tells you how
to launch the program.
</li>
</ol>
</li><li>
Linux:  We haven't yet ported the program to Linux.
<ol>
<li>
Install OpenGL and freeGLUT (already installed on the SEASnet Linux
servers cs32.seas.ucla.edu, lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu, lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu,
and lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu):
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu: <code>sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev</code></li>
<li>Fedora: <code>sudo yum install freeglut freeglut-devel</code></li>
</ul>
</li><li>
Unzip <a href="NachenBlaster-sample-linux.zip">the sample executable
zip</a>.  Change into the NachenBlaster directory.  In that directory
there is a file named README that tells you how to launch the program. 
You won't hear any sound effects.  We haven't tested the Linux version
beyond ensuring it builds and tries to connect to an X11 server, but it
should work if you set your DISPLAY environment variable correctly, which
we haven't had a chance to try.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can also download the project skeletons with the code we've written,
for <a href="NachenBlaster-skeleton-windows.zip">Windows</a>,
<a href="NachenBlaster-skeleton-mac.zip">Mac</a>, or
<a href="linux.html">Linux</a>, and make sure you can build and run them. 
All they'll do is have you lose a life each time you hit Enter, but at
least you can verify that the graphics library works.
</p><p>
The <strong>only</strong> files you will modify are Actor.h, Actor.cpp,
StudentWorld.h, and StudentWorld.cpp.  Indeed, those will be the only code
files you'll turn in, so in implementing your solution, you must
<strong>not</strong> depend on any changes you make to code files other than
those four.
</p><p>
At some point in Project 3, you may find the
<a href="../../stringstreams.html">Stringstreams</a> writeup helpful.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Note for Visual C++ users:  If the Windows skeleton doesn't build for you,
you probably need to ensure that your project is using Windows SDK Version
10.0.15063.0.  To do this:
</p>
<ol style="margin-top:0">
<li>
Launch the Visual Studio Installer, find your version of Visual Studio,
and select Modify.  In the list on the right side of optional packages,
make sure SDK 10.0.15063.0 is selected.
</li><li>
After modifying your Visual Studio installation, open the project in Visual
Studio and right-click on Solution 'NachenBlaster' above the list of source
files.  Select Retarget Solution and choose the newly installed version of
the SDK.
</li><li>
Build the project.
</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Notes for Xcode users:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0">
<li>
You might get a message at startup relating to the Assets
directory.  If you want to fix the issue just for this project, select
File / Project Settings... and for Derived Data Location, select
Project-relative Location.  If instead you want to fix it for every
project you create with Xcode, select Xcode / Preferences... and for the
Derived Data, select Relative.
</li><li>
If your version of Xcode is too old, you'll get a message about the xcodeproj
file being an incompatible project version.  If your Mac is such that you
cannot install a recent version of Xcode to solve this problem, use this
<a href="NachenBlaster-skeleton-macold.zip">skeleton for old Xcode
versions</a>.
</li>
</ul>
