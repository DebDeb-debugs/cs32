<h2>Programming Assignment 4<br />
Cracked</h2>
<p>
<strong>Due 11:00 PM Thursday, March 15</strong><br/>
</p>
</div>
<p>
The <a href="spec.pdf">Project 4 specification document</a> is complete. 
</p><p>
3/13 8:20 pm:  [Most relevant to Visual C++ users]  If decrypting a message
is correct but inordinately slow, try building your program in
<a href="../../Homeworks/4/vcreleasemode.html">Release mode</a>.  Problem 6
of <a href="../../Homeworks/4/spec.html#P6">Homework 4</a> says how to do the
same in Xcode and mentions g32fast, although the speedup may not be as
great for those compilers.
</p><p>
3/12 2:00 am:  Here is our <a href="p4sanity.zip">sanity checker for
Project 4</a> that <strong>must build without errors</strong> under g32. 
If it does not also run without errors, then you did not properly
implement something.  Download the zip file (p4sanity.zip), add your five
files to it, then transfer it to cs32.seas.ucla.edu as the
<a href="../../linux.html">g++ with Linux</a> writeup tells you.  Log into
the Linux server, and unzip that zip file, which will create a directory
named p4sanity.  Change directories into that directory and type the
commands
</p>
<pre>
	make
	./p4sanity
</pre>
<p>
You can read the code in p4sanity.cpp to see what it does.  To turn off
testing for one or more classes that build but that you know don't work
well enough to be tested, set the appropriate boolean near the top of the
p4sanity.cpp file to false.
</p><p>
3/12 1:30 am:  Step 7 was added to the algorithm on p. 7 of the spec.  If
you understood how the algorithm worked, you'd have discovered it needed
to be there.
</p><p>
3/11 11:30 pm:  If you want to copy and paste the sample encrypted messages
on p.33 of the spec, copying them from the spec PDF might pick up tab
characters instead of space characters.  Either type the messages
yourself, or copy and paste them from <a href="testmessages.txt">this text
page</a>.
</p><p>
3/11 10:30 am:  [Relevant to Visual C++ users only]  If the workaround
mentioned in the update dated 3/10 2:15 pm doesn't work for you, rename
the function <em>hash</em> to a name like <em>hasher</em> that is not in
the namespace std.  (Retain the name <em>hash</em> in the return statements
in the bodies of the three little hash functions we gave you.)
</p><p>
3/10 4:45 pm:  Sean Yin gets a free meal.  If you don't understand why,
you will eventually.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0">
3/10 2:15 pm:  [Relevant to Visual C++ users only]  Visual C++ does not
correctly implement the C++ two-phase-lookup rules, so for Visual C++,
the code in a MyHash member function implementation that spec p. 19 says
would in Standard C++ be
</p>
<pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
	unsigned int hash(const KeyType&amp; k);  // prototype
	unsigned int h = hash(key);
</pre>
<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
would, for Visual C++ only, be
</p>
<pre style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
	unsigned int ::hash(const KeyType&amp; k);  // prototype
	unsigned int h = ::hash(key);
</pre>
<p style="margin-top:0">
When you build your program under g32, remove those two <code>::</code>,
and leave them out in the version of MyHash.h you turn in.
</p><p>
3/10 1:00 pm:  The description of how to use the Translator class on pp.
25-27 was edited to clarify how the initial state of the Translator and the
pushMapping and popMapping operations affect the current mapping table.
</p><p>
3/9 8:30 pm:  The spec had put a restriction on how you implement WordList
that was stricter than we intended, so it's been loosened to capture our
intent:  You can't use a vector, say, as a data member of WordList, but you
can use vector in a template argument to your MyHash class template (perhaps
you have an instantiation of MyHash as a data member).
</p><p>
3/9 3:30 pm:  There was a change to MyHash::find.  If you have already
written that function, you presumably can just make your code the
implementation of <code>const ValueType* find(const KeyType&amp; key)
const</code>; we implemented the non-const version <code>ValueType*
find(const KeyType&amp; key)</code> in the skeleton MyHash.h.
</p><p>
The posted <a href="skeleton.zip">skeleton code</a> includes a main
routine you can use to test the whole system, as well as skeletons for the
MyHash class template and the Tokenizer, WordList, Translator, and
Decrypter classes.
</p><p>
If you are having trouble implementing MyHash, then rather than being blocked
from proceeding with the other classes, you may temporarily use this
<a href="substituteMyHash.h">substitute MyHash.h</a>, which is a correct
implementation of MyHash, but one you cannot turn in since it uses the STL
unordered_map type, which the spec forbids.  After working on the other
classes, you can come back to finish fixing your own MyHash.
