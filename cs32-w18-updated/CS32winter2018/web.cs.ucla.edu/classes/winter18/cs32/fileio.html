<h2>File I/O</h2>
</div>
<p>
In order to read input from a file instead of from the keyboard, or write
output to a file instead of to the screen, you must use the C++ facilities
for file input and/or output.  To begin with, use these headers:
</p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;iostream>
	#include &lt;fstream>
</pre>
<p>
Including the <code>&lt;fstream></code> header defines two classes:
<code>std::ifstream</code>, the <em>input file stream</em> class, and
<code>std::ofstream</code>, the <em>output file stream</em> class.  For the
rest of this tutorial, assume we've said <code>using namespace std;</code>
so that we can leave off the <code>std::</code>.
</p>
<h4>Output</h4>
<p>
Let's examine output first, since it's simpler.  If we want to write
output to a file named <code>results.txt</code>, we create an
<code>ofstream</code> object attached to that file, and write to that
object.  Here is sample code:
</p>
<pre>
	ofstream outfile("results.txt");   // outfile is a name of our choosing.
	if ( ! outfile )		   // Did the creation fail?
	{
	    cerr &lt;&lt; "Error: Cannot create results.txt!" &lt;&lt; endl;
	    <em>... return with failure ...   </em>
	}
	outfile &lt;&lt; "This will be written to the file" &lt;&lt; endl;
	outfile &lt;&lt; "2 + 2 = " &lt;&lt; 2+2 &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre>
<p>
The first line creates an <code>ofstream</code> object named
<code>outfile</code> (which we could have called whatever we wanted) and
attempts to attach it to the file named <code>results.txt</code>.  If
<code>results.txt</code> does not already exist, it will be created;
otherwise, the old contents of that file are wiped out so that what this
program writes will be the new contents of the file.
</p>
<p>
If you specify a complete path name, like "C:/CS32/P4/results.txt" (note the
use of forward slashes), the file will be in the folder you'd expect on a
Windows machine, C:\CS32\P4.  If you do not specify a complete path name
and you've launched the program from the Visual Studio environment, the
file will be in the same folder as your C++ source file; if you launch it
from a Windows command line or the shell running in a macOS Terminal
window or under Linux, the file will be in the current directory; if you
launch it from Xcode, the file will be in the
<em>yourProject</em>/DerivedData/<em>yourProject</em>/Build/Products/Debug
folder, which is a good reason to give a simpler complete pathname like
"/Users/<em>yourUsername</em>/CS32/P4/results.txt" or "/Users/<em>yourUserName</em>/Desktop/results.txt".
</p>
<p>
It's possible the attempt to create the file may fail.  If so, the stream
object <code>outfile</code> knows internally that it is in a failure state
instead of a good state.  You can test the state of the stream:  the
expression <code>!outfile</code> yields true if <code>outfile</code> is in a
failure state, and false otherwise.
</p>
<p>
If the file was successfully created, you may write to it just as you would to
<code>cout</code> or <code>cerr</code>.
</p>
<h4>Input</h4>
<p>
If we want to read input from a file instead of the keyboard, we create an
<code>ifstream</code> object attached to that file and read from that
object.  If the file doesn't already exist, the <code>ifstream</code>
object will be in a failure state.
</p>
<pre>
	ifstream infile("data.txt");    // infile is a name of our choosing
	if ( ! infile )		        // Did opening the file fail?
	{
	    cerr &lt;&lt; "Error: Cannot open data.txt!" &lt;&lt; endl;
	    <em>... return with failure ...   </em>
	}
</pre>
<p>
As with output files, if you specify a complete path name, like
"C:/CS32/P4/data.txt" (note the use of forward slashes), the program will look
for the file in the folder you'd expect, C:\CS32\P4.  If you do not
specify a complete path name, the program will look in the same folder
it would create a file in if you didn't supply a complete path name (see the
Output section above).
</p>
<p>
We can now read from the file by reading from the stream <code>infile</code>.
There are a number of ways we can read from the stream.  To read an integer:
</p>
<pre>
	int k;
	infile >> k;
	  // If you want to consume and ignore the rest of the line the
	  // number is found on, follow this with
	infile.ignore(10000, '\n');
</pre>
<p>
To read a <code>std::string</code>:
</p>
<pre>
	std::string s;
	infile >> s;         // read the next word into s
	  // or
	getline(infile, s);  // read a whole line into s
</pre>
<p>
To read the next character from the input, whether it's a letter, blank,
newline, or whatever:
</p>
<pre>
	char c;
	infile.get(c);
</pre>
<p>
When reading input, there's a possibility that the operation will fail because
there are no more characters in the file to be read (i.e., we have encountered
the end of the file).  In that case, the <code>ifstream</code> object will be
put into a failure state.  Also, if an attempt to read a number fails because
the first non-whitespace encountered is not a valid part of a number (e.g.,
it's a <code>z</code>, the stream will be put into a failure state.  Here are
some examples:
</p>
<pre>
	  // Example 1
	std::string s;
	getline(infile, s);
	if ( ! infile)
	    cerr << "End of file when trying to read a string" << end;

	  // Example 2 - read and process each line of a file until end
	std::string s;
	  // getline returns infile; the while tests its success/failure state
	while (getline(infile, s))
	{
	    <em>... process</em> s
	}

	  // Example 3 - read and process each character of a file until end
	char c;
	  // get returns infile; the while tests its success/failure state
	while (infile.get(c))
	{
	    <em>... process</em> c
	}

	  // Example 4 - read and process each integer in a file until end
	int k;
	  // operator>> returns infile; the while tests its success/failure state
	while (infile >> k)
	{
	    <em>... process</em> k
	}
</pre>
<!--
<p>
When reading input, there's a possibility that the operation will fail because
there are no more characters in the file to be read (i.e., we have encountered
the end of the file).  This leads to a common idiom for reading and processing
every character of a file, one by one:
</p>
<pre>
	char c;
	while (infile.getc(c))
	{
	    <em>... process</em> c
	}
</pre>
<p>
The expression in the while loop will attempt to read the next character
from the file, putting the stream in a failure state if the attempt fails
(i.e., we've reached end of file), in which case we leave the loop.
</p>
-->
<p>
<strong>Caution:</strong>  Some misinformed people mistakenly believe that the
pattern for reading input until end of file is <code>while (!infile.eof()) {
infile.get(c); <em>... process</em> c <em>...</em> }</code>.  This is wrong!
(If you care why, it's because the <code>eof</code> member function does not
return true until <em>after</em> an attempt to read past the end of file is
made.)
</p>
<h4>Stream parameters</h4>
<p>
Suppose we wanted to write a function that writes some output to either a
file or to the screen, at the option of the caller of the function.  We can
do this by having the function accept as a parameter a reference to the desired
output stream:
</p>
<pre>
	void greet(ostream&amp; outf)    // outf is a name of our choosing
	{
	    outf &lt;&lt; "Hello" &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
</pre>
<p>
Notice that the type named in the parameter declaration is
<code>ostream</code>, not <code>ofstream</code>, and that the parameter is
passed by reference.  An <code>ostream</code> reference can refer to any
kind of output stream:  to <code>cout</code> or to any <code>ofstream</code>
attached to a file.  (This is because <code>ostream</code> is a base class
of <code>ofstream</code>.)  Here's an example:
</p>
<pre>
	int main()
	{
	    ofstream outfile("greeting.txt");
	    if ( ! outfile )
	    {
	        cerr &lt;&lt; "Error: Cannot create greeting.txt!" &lt;&lt; endl;
	        return 1;
	    }
	    greet(outfile); // writes Hello to the file greetings.txt
	    greet(cout);    // writes Hello to the screen
	}
</pre>
<p>
Similarly, if we wanted to have a function read input from either a file or
the keyboard, we'd have it take a parameter that is a reference to a general
input stream (an <code>istream</code>):
</p>
<pre>
	int countLines(istream&amp; inf)   // inf is a name of our choosing
	{
	    int lineCount = 0;
	    string line;
	    while (getline(inf, line))
		    lineCount++;
	    return lineCount;
	}

	int main()
	{
	    ifstream infile("data.txt");
	    if ( ! infile )
	    {
	        cerr &lt;&lt; "Error: Cannot open data.txt!" &lt;&lt; endl;
	        return 1;
	    }
	    int fileLines = countLines(infile);  // reads from the file data.txt
	    cout &lt;&lt; "data.txt has " &lt;&lt; fileLines &lt;&lt; " lines." &lt;&lt; endl;
	    cout &lt;&lt; "Type lines, then ctrl-Z (Windows) or ctrl-D (UNIX):" &lt;&lt; endl;
	    int keyboardLines = countLines(cin); // reads from keyboard
	    cout &lt;&lt; "You typed " &lt;&lt; keyboardLines &lt;&lt; " lines." &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
</pre>
<p>
To indicate end of file for keyboard input (i.e., to tell the program that
there's no more that will <em>ever</em> be typed in for the rest of this
run of the program), type control-Z on a line by itself (Windows), or control-D
on a line by itself (UNIX).  That character does <em>not</em> get delivered to
the program; instead, <code>cin</code> will internally record that it is in
a failure state.  Consider the <code>countLines</code> example above, when it
is called with <code>cin</code> as the input stream that the parameter
<code>inf</code> will refer to.  When in response to the call to
<code>getline</code> the user just types control-Z (or control-D),
<code>cin</code> is put in a failure state, and the <code>getline</code> call
yields false, so control leaves the loop.
</p>
<p>
Here's a summary of some names the library defines:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>istream</code></dt><dd>The general input stream type.</dd>
<dt><code>ifstream</code></dt><dd>The input file stream type; an
<code>ifstream</code> object will be associated with a particular file.  An
<code>ifstream</code> object is one kind of <code>istream</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>cin</code></dt><dd>The input stream object associated with the
keyboard.  <code>cin</code> is another kind of <code>istream</code> object.</dd>
<dt><code>ostream</code></dt><dd>The general output stream type.</dd>
<dt><code>ofstream</code></dt><dd>The output file stream type; an
<code>ofstream</code> object will be associated with a particular file. 
An <code>ofstream</code> object is one kind of <code>ostream</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>cout</code></dt><dd>The output stream object associated with the
screen.  <code>cout</code> is another kind of <code>ostream</code> object.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The names <code>ifstream</code> and <code>ofstream</code> are defined by the
header <code>&lt;fstream></code>.  The other four are defined by the header
<code>&lt;iostream></code>.  Generally, if you include
<code>&lt;fstream></code> you must also include <code>&lt;iostream></code>.
