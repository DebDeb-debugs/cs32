<h2>Homework 1</h2>
<p>
<strong>Time due: 11:00 PM Tuesday, January 23</strong>
</p>
</div>
<p>
Here is a C++ class definition for an abstract data type <strong>Map
from <code>string</code> to <code>double</code></strong>, representing the
concept of a function mapping <code>string</code>s to <code>double</code>s.
(For example, we could represent a collection of students and their GPAs: 
"Fred" maps to 2.956, "Ethel" maps to 3.538, "Lucy" maps to 2.956, etc.) 
We'll call the <code>string</code>s the <em>keys</em> and the
<code>double</code>s the <em>values</em>.  No two keys in the map are
allowed to be the same (e.g., so "Fred" appears no more than once),
although two keys might map to the same value (as in the example, where
both of the keys "Fred" and "Lucy" map to the value 2.956).  To make
things simpler for you, the case of letters in a string matters, so that
the strings <code>Fred</code> and <code>fReD</code> are <em>not</em>
considered duplicates.
</p>
<pre>
class Map
{
  public:
    Map();         // Create an empty map (i.e., one with no key/value pairs)

    bool empty();  // Return true if the map is empty, otherwise false.

    int size();    // Return the number of key/value pairs in the map.

    bool insert(const std::string&amp; key, const double&amp; value);
      // If key is not equal to any key currently in the map, and if the
      // key/value pair can be added to the map, then do so and return true.
      // Otherwise, make no change to the map and return false (indicating
      // that either the key is already in the map, or the map has a fixed
      // capacity and is full).

    bool update(const std::string&amp; key, const double&amp; value);
      // If key is equal to a key currently in the map, then make that key no
      // longer map to the value it currently maps to, but instead map to
      // the value of the second parameter; return true in this case.
      // Otherwise, make no change to the map and return false.

    bool insertOrUpdate(const std::string&amp; key, const double&amp; value);
      // If key is equal to a key currently in the map, then make that key no
      // longer map to the value it currently maps to, but instead map to
      // the value of the second parameter; return true in this case.
      // If key is not equal to any key currently in the map and if the
      // key/value pair can be added to the map, then do so and return true.
      // Otherwise, make no change to the map and return false (indicating
      // that the key is not already in the map and the map has a fixed
      // capacity and is full).

    bool erase(const std::string&amp; key);
      // If key is equal to a key currently in the map, remove the key/value
      // pair with that key from the map and return true.  Otherwise, make
      // no change to the map and return false.
     
    bool contains(const std::string&amp; key);
      // Return true if key is equal to a key currently in the map, otherwise
      // false.
     
    bool get(const std::string&amp; key, double&amp; value);
      // If key is equal to a key currently in the map, set value to the
      // value in the map that that key maps to, and return true.  Otherwise,
      // make no change to the value parameter of this function and return
      // false.
     
    bool get(int i, std::string&amp; key, double&amp; value);
      // If 0 &lt;= i &lt; size(), copy into the key and value parameters the
      // key and value of one of the key/value pairs in the map and return
      // true.  Otherwise, leave the key and value parameters unchanged and
      // return false.  (See below for details about this function.)

    void swap(Map&amp; other);
      // Exchange the contents of this map with the other one.
};
</pre>
<p>
(When we don't want a function to change a key or value parameter, we pass
that parameter by constant reference.  Passing it by value would have been
perfectly fine for this problem, but we chose the const reference alternative
because that will be more suitable after we make some generalizations in a
later problem.)
</p><p>
The three-argument <code>get</code> function enables a client to iterate over
all elements of a <code>Map</code> because of this property it must have:
If nothing is inserted into or erased from the map in the interim, then
calling that version of <code>get</code> size() times with the first parameter
ranging over each of the integers from 0 to size()-1 inclusive will copy
into the other parameters every key/value pair from the map exactly once. 
The order in which key/value pairs are copied is up to you.  In other
words, this client code fragment
</p>
<pre>
    Map m;
    m.insert("A", 10);
    m.insert("B", 44);
    m.insert("C", 10);
    string all;
    double total = 0;
    for (int n = 0; n &lt; m.size(); n++)
    {
        string k;
        double v;
        m.get(n, k, v);
        all += k;
        total += v;
    }
    cout << all << total;
</pre>
<p>
must result in the output being exactly one of the following:
<code>ABC64</code>, <code>ACB64</code>, <code>BAC64</code>, <code>BCA64</code>,
<code>CAB64</code>, or <code>CBA64</code>, and the client can't depend on it
being any particular one of those six.  If the map is modified between
successive calls to the three-argument form of <code>get</code>, all bets are
off as to whether a particular key/value pair is returned exactly once.
</p><p>
If nothing is inserted into or erased from the map in the interim, then
calling the three-argument form of <code>get</code> repeatedly with the same
value for the first parameter each time must copy the same key into the second
parameter each time and the same value into the third parameter each time, so
that this code is fine:
</p>
<pre>
    Map gpas;
    gpas.insert("Fred", 2.956);
    gpas.insert("Ethel", 3.538);
    double v;
    string k1;
    assert(gpas.get(1,k1,v)  &amp;&amp;  (k1 == "Fred"  ||  k1 == "Ethel"));
    string k2;
    assert(gpas.get(1,k2,v)  &amp;&amp;  k2 == k1);
</pre>
<p>
Notice that the empty string is just as good a string as any other; you should
not treat it in any special way:
</p>
<pre>
    Map gpas;
    gpas.insert("Fred", 2.956);
    assert(!gpas.contains(""));
    gpas.insert("Ethel", 3.538);
    gpas.insert("", 4.000);
    gpas.insert("Lucy", 2.956);
    assert(gpas.contains(""));
    gpas.erase("Fred");
    assert(gpas.size() == 3  &amp;&amp  gpas.contains("Lucy")  &amp;&amp;  gpas.contains("Ethel")  &amp;&amp;
                gpas.contains(""));
</pre>
<p>
Here's an example of the <code>swap</code> function:
</p>
<pre>
    Map m1;
    m1.insert("Fred", 2.956);
    Map m2;
    m2.insert("Ethel", 3.538);
    m2.insert("Lucy", 2.956);
    m1.swap(m2);
    assert(m1.size() == 2  &amp;&amp;  m1.contains("Ethel")  &amp;&amp;  m1.contains("Lucy")  &amp;&amp;
           m2.size() == 1  &amp;&amp;  m2.contains("Fred"));
</pre>
<p>
When comparing keys for <code>insert</code>, <code>update</code>,
<code>insertOrUpdate</code>, <code>erase</code>, <code>contains</code>, and
the two-argument form of <code>get</code>, just use the <code>==</code> or
<code>!=</code> operators provided for the string type by the library.  These
do case-sensitive comparisons, and that's fine.
</p><p>
Here is what you are to do:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Determine which member functions of the Map class should be const member
functions (because they do not modify the Map), and change the class
declaration accordingly.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
As defined above, the Map class allows the client to use a map that
contains only <code>std::string</code>s as keys and <code>double</code>s
as values.  Someone who wanted to modify the class to contain keys or
values of another type, such as keys being <code>int</code>s and values
being <code>int</code>s, would have to make changes in many places. 
Modify the class definition you produced in the previous problem to use a
type alias for all keys wherever the original
definition used a <code>std::string</code> for that purpose, and a
type alias for all values wherever the original
definition used a <code>double</code> for that purpose.  A <em>type alias</em>
is a name that is a synonym for some type; here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
      // The following line introduces the type alias Number as a synonym
      // for the type int; anywhere the code uses the name Number, it means
      // the type int.

    using Number = int;

    int main()
    {
        Number total = 0;
        Number x;
        while (cin >> x)
            total += x;
        cout &lt;&lt; total &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
</pre>
<p>
The advantage of using the type alias Number is that if we later wish to
modify this code to sum a sequence of <code>long</code>s or of
<code>double</code>s, we need make a change in only one place:  the using
statement introducing the type alias Number.
</p><p>
(Aside:  Prior to C++11 (and still usable now), the only way to introduce
a type alias was to use a <code>typedef</code> statement, e.g.
<code>typedef int Number;</code>.  Appendix A.1.8 of the textbook describes
<code>typedef</code>.)
</p><p>
To make the grader's life easier, we'll require that everyone use the same
synonyms for their type aliases:  You must use the name
<code>KeyType</code> for the name of the type used for keys, and
<code>ValueType</code> for the name of the type used for values, with
exactly those spellings and cases.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Now that you have defined an interface for a map class where the key and the
value types can be easily changed, implement the class and all its member
functions in such a way that the key/value pairs in a map are contained in a
data member that is an array.  (Notice we said an array, not a pointer.  It's
not until problem 5 of this homework that you'll deal with a dynamically
allocated array.)  A map must be able to hold a maximum of
<code>DEFAULT_MAX_ITEMS</code> distinct keys, where
</p>
<pre>
    const int DEFAULT_MAX_ITEMS = 250;
</pre>
<p>
(Hint:  Define a structure type containing a member of type KeyType and a
member of type ValueType.  Have Map's array data member be an array of these
structures.)
</p><p>
Test your class for a Map that maps <code>std::string</code>s to
<code>double</code>s.  Place your class definition, non-inline function
prototypes, and inline function implementations (if any) in a file named
<code>Map.h</code>, and your non-inline function implementations (if any)
in a file named <code>Map.cpp</code>.  (If we haven't yet discussed inline,
then if you haven't encountered the topic yourself, all your functions will
be non-inline, which is fine.)
</p><p>
Except to add a <code>dump</code> function (described below), you must not
add public data or function members to, delete functions from, or change the
public interface of the Map class.  You must not declare any additional
struct/class outside the Map class, and you must not declare any
<em>public</em> struct/class inside the Map class.  You may add whatever
private data members and private member functions you like, and
you may declare <em>private</em> structs/classes inside the Map class if you
like.
</p><p>
If you wish, you may add a public member function with the signature
<code>void dump() const</code>.  The intent of this function is that for
your own testing purposes, you can call it to print information about the
map; we will never call it.  You do not have to add this function if you
don't want to, but if you do add it, it must not make any changes to the
map; if we were to replace your implementation of this function with one
that simply returned immediately, your code must still work correctly. 
The <code>dump</code> function must not write to <code>cout</code>, but
it's allowed to write to <code>cerr</code>.
</p><p>
Your implementation of the Map class must be such that the
compiler-generated destructor, copy constructor, and assignment operator
do the right things.  Write a test program named <code>testMap.cpp</code>
to make sure your Map class implementation works properly.  Here is one
possible (incomplete) test program:
</p>
<pre>
    #include "Map.h"
    #include &lt;iostream>
    #include &lt;cassert>
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        Map m;  // maps strings to doubles
        assert(m.empty());
        ValueType v = -1234.5;
        assert( !m.get("abc", v)  &amp;&amp;  v == -1234.5); // v unchanged by get failure
        m.insert("xyz", 9876.5);
        assert(m.size() == 1);
        KeyType k = "hello";
        assert(m.get(0, k, v)  &amp;&amp;  k == "xyz"  &amp;&amp;  v == 9876.5);
        cout &lt;&lt; "Passed all tests" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
</pre>
<p>
Now change (only) the two type aliases in <code>Map.h</code> so that the
Map type will now map <code>int</code>s to <code>std::string</code>s. 
Make no other changes to <code>Map.h</code>, and make no changes to
<code>Map.cpp</code>.  Verify that your implementation builds correctly
and works properly with this alternative main routine (which again, is not
a complete test of correctness):
</p>
<pre>
    #include "Map.h"
    #include &lt;iostream>
    #include &lt;cassert>
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        Map m;  // maps ints to strings
        assert(m.empty());
        ValueType v = "Ouch";
        assert( !m.get(42, v)  &amp;&amp;  v == "Ouch"); // v unchanged by get failure
        m.insert(123456789, "Wow!");
        assert(m.size() == 1);
        KeyType k = 9876543;
        assert(m.get(0, k, v)  &amp;&amp;  k == 123456789  &amp;&amp;  v == "Wow!");
        cout &lt;&lt; "Passed all tests" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
</pre>
<p>
You may need to flip back and forth a few times to fix your <code>Map.h</code>
and <code>Map.cpp</code> code so that the <em>only</em> change to those files
you'd need to make to change a map's key and value types is to the two
type aliases in <code>Map.h</code>.  (When you turn in the project, have the
type aliases in <code>Map.h</code> specify the key type to be
<code>std::string</code> and the value type to be <code>double</code>.)
</p><p>
Except in a using statement in <code>Map.h</code> introducing a type alias,
the word <code>double</code> must not appear in <code>Map.h</code> or
<code>Map.cpp</code>.  Except in a using statement introducing a type alias
and in the context of <code>#include &lt;string></code> in <code>Map.h</code>,
the word <code>string</code> must not appear in <code>Map.h</code> or
<code>Map.cpp</code>.
</p><p>
(Implementation note 1:  If you declare another structure to help you
implement a Map, put its declaration in <code>Map.h</code> (and
<code>newMap.h</code> for Problem 5), since it is not intended to be used
by clients for its own sake, but merely to help you implement the Map
class.  In fact, to enforce clients' not using that structure type, don't
declare it outside of the Map class; instead, declare that helper
structure in the <em>private</em> section of Map.  Although it would
probably be overkill for this structure to have anything more than two
public data members, if for some reason you decide to declare any member
functions for it that need to be implemented, those implementations should
be in <code>Map.cpp</code> (and <code>newMap.cpp</code> for Problem 5).) 
</p><p>
(Implementation note 2:  The <code>swap</code> function is easily
implementable without creating any additional array or additional Map.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Now that you've implemented the class, write some client code that uses it.  We
might want a class that keeps track of a fleet of cars and how many gallons of
gas are in each car's tank.  Implement the following class:
</p>
<pre>
    #include "Map.h"

    class CarMap
    {
      public:
        CarMap();       // Create an empty car map.

        bool addCar(std::string license);
          // If a car with the given license plate is not currently in the map, 
          // and there is room in the map, add an entry for that car recording
          // that it has 0 gallons of gas in it, and return true.  Otherwise,
          // make no change to the map and return false.

        double gas(std::string license) const;
          // If a car with the given license plate is in the map, return the
          // number of gallons of gas in its tank; otherwise, return -1.

        bool addGas(std::string license, double gallons);
          // If no car with the given license plate is in the map or if
          // gallons is negative, make no change to the map and return
          // false.  Otherwise, increase the number of gallons of gas in the
          // indicated car by the gallons parameter and return true.

        bool useGas(std::string license, double gallons);
          // If no car with the given license plate is in the map or if
          // gallons is negative or if gallons > gas(), make no change to the
          // map and return false.  Otherwise, decrease the number of gallons
          // of gas in the indicated car by the gallons parameter and return
          // true.

        int fleetSize() const;  // Return the number of cars in the CarMap.

        void print() const;
          // Write to cout one line for every car in the map.  Each line
          // consists of the car's license plate, followed by one space,
          // followed by the number of gallons in that car's tank.  Write
          // no other text.

      private:
        // Some of your code goes here.
    };
</pre>
<p>
Your CarMap implementation must employ a data member of type Map that uses
the type aliases <code>KeyType</code> and <code>ValueType</code> as synonyms
for <code>std::string</code> and <code>double</code>, respectively.  (Notice
we said a member of type <em>Map</em>, not of type <em>pointer to
Map</em>.)  Except for the using statements introducing the type aliases, you
must not make any changes to the <code>Map.h</code> and <code>Map.cpp</code>
files you produced for Problem 3, so you must not add any member functions
to the Map class.  Each of the member functions <code>addCar</code>,
<code>gas</code>, <code>addGas</code>, <code>useGas</code>,
<code>fleetSize</code>, and <code>print</code> must delegate as much of
the work that they need to do as they can to Map member functions.  (In
other words, they must not do work themselves that they can ask Map member
functions to do instead.)  If the compiler-generated destructor, copy
constructor, and assignment operator for CarMap don't do the right thing,
declare and implement them.  Write a program to test your CarMap class. 
Name your files <code>CarMap.h</code>, <code>CarMap.cpp</code>, and
<code>testCarMap.cpp</code>.
</p><p>
The words <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> must not appear in
<code>CarMap.h</code> or <code>CarMap.cpp</code>, except in the
implementation of <code>CarMap::print</code> if you wish.  The
characters <code>[</code> (open square bracket) and <code>*</code> must
not appear in <code>CarMap.h</code> or <code>CarMap.cpp</code>,
except in comments if you wish.  You do not have to change
<code>std::string</code> to <code>KeyType</code> and <code>double</code>
to <code>ValueType</code> in <code>CarMap.h</code> and
<code>CarMap.cpp</code> if you don't want to (since unlike Map, which is
designed for a wide variety of key and value types, CarMap is
specifically designed to work with strings and doubles).  In the code you
turn in, <code>CarMap</code>'s member functions must not call
<code>Map::dump</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Now that you've created a map type based on arrays whose size is fixed at
compile time, let's change the implementation to use a <em>dynamically
allocated</em> array of objects.  Copy the three files you produced for
problem 3, naming the new files <code>newMap.h</code>,
<code>newMap.cpp</code>, and <code>testnewMap.cpp</code>.  Update those
files by either adding another constructor or modifying your existing
constructor so that a client can do the following:
</p>
<pre>
     Map a(1000);   // a can hold at most 1000 key/value pairs
     Map b(5);      // b can hold at most 5 key/value pairs
     Map c;         // c can hold at most DEFAULT_MAX_ITEMS key/value pairs
     KeyType k[6] = { <em>a list of six distinct values of the appropriate type</em> };
     ValueType v  = <em>a value of the appropriate type</em>;

       // No failures inserting pairs with 5 distinct keys into b
     for (int n = 0; n &lt; 5; n++)
         assert(b.insert(k[n], v));

       // Failure if we try to insert a pair with a sixth distinct key into b
     assert(!b.insert(k[5], v));

       // When two Maps' contents are swapped, their capacities are swapped
       // as well:
     a.swap(b);
     assert(!a.insert(k[5], v)  &amp;&amp;  b.insert(k[5], v));

</pre>
<p>
Since the compiler-generated destructor, copy constructor, and assignment
operator no longer do the right thing, declare them (as public members) and
implement them.  Make no other changes to the public interface of your class.
(You are free to make changes to the private members and to the
implementations of the member functions, and you may add or remove private
members.)  Change the implementation of the <code>swap</code> function so
that the number of statement executions when swapping two maps is the same
no matter how many key/value pairs are in the maps.  (You would not
satisfy this requirement if, for example, your swap function caused a loop
to visit each pair in the map, since the number of statements executed by
all the iterations of the loop would depend on the number of pairs in the
map.) 
</p><p>
The character <code>[</code> (open square bracket) must not appear in
<code>newMap.h</code> (but is fine in <code>newMap.cpp</code>).
</p><p>
Test your new implementation of the Map class.  (Notice that even
though the file is named <code>newMap.h</code>, the name of the class
defined therein must still be <code>Map</code>.)
</p><p>
Verify that your CarMap class still works properly with this new
version of Map.  You should not need to change your CarMap class or its
implementation in any way, other than to include <code>"newMap.h"</code>
instead of <code>"Map.h"</code>.  (For this test, be sure to link with
<code>newMap.cpp</code>, not <code>Map.cpp</code>.)  (Before you turn in
<code>CarMap.h</code>, be sure to restore the include to
<code>"Map.h"</code> instead of <code>"newMap.h"</code>.)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Turn it in</h3>
<p>
By Monday, January 22, there will be a link on the class webpage that will
enable you to turn in this homework.  Turn in one zip file that contains your
solutions to the homework problems.  (Since problem 3 builds on problems 1 and
2, you will not turn in separate code for problems 1 and 2.)  If you solve
every problem, the zip file you turn in will have nine files (three for
each of problems 3, 4, and 5). The files <em>must</em> meet these requirements,
or your score on this homework will be severely reduced:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Each of the header files <code>Map.h</code>, <code>CarMap.h</code>,
and <code>newMap.h</code> must have an appropriate include guard.  In
the files you turn in, the using statements in <code>Map.h</code> and
<code>newMap.h</code> must introduce <code>KeyType</code> as a type alias
for <code>std::string</code> and <code>ValueType</code> as a type alias for
<code>double</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
If we create a project consisting of <code>Map.h</code>,
<code>Map.cpp</code>, and <code>testMap.cpp</code>, it must build
successfully under both g32 and either Visual C++ or clang++.  (Note:  To
build an executable using g32 from some, but not all, of the .cpp files in
a directory, you list the .cpp files to use in the command.  To build an
executable named <code>req1</code> for this requirement, for example,
you'd say <code>g32 -o req1 Map.cpp testMap.cpp</code>.)
</p></li><li><p>
If we create a project consisting of <code>Map.h</code>,
<code>Map.cpp</code>, <code>CarMap.h</code>,
<code>CarMap.cpp</code>, and <code>testCarMap.cpp</code>, it must build
successfully under both g32 and either Visual C++ or clang++.
</p></li><li><p>
If we create a project consisting of <code>newMap.h</code>,
<code>newMap.cpp</code>, and <code>testnewMap.cpp</code>, it must
build successfully under both g32 and either Visual C++ or clang++.
</p></li><li><p>
If we create a project consisting of <code>newMap.h</code>,
<code>newMap.cpp</code>, and <code>testMap.cpp</code>, where in
<code>testMap.cpp</code> we change only the
<code>#include "Map.h"</code> to <code>#include "newMap.h"</code>,
the project must build successfully under both g32 and either Visual C++ or
clang++.  (If you try this, be sure to change the <code>#include</code>
back to <code>"Map.h"</code> before you turn in <code>testMap.cpp</code>.)
</p></li><li><p>
The source files you submit for this homework must not contain the word
<code>friend</code> or <code>vector</code>, and must not contain any
global variables whose values may be changed during execution.  (Global
<em>constants</em> are fine.)
</p></li><li><p>
No files other than those whose names begin with <code>test</code> may
contain code that reads anything from <code>cin</code> or writes anything
to <code>cout</code>, except that for problem 4,
<code>CarMap::print</code> must write to <code>cout</code>, and for
problem 5, the implementation of the constructor that takes an integer
parameter may write a message and exit the program if the integer is
negative.  Any file may write to <code>cerr</code> (perhaps for debugging
purposes); we will ignore any output written to <code>cerr</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
You must have an implementation for every member function of Map and
CarMap.  If you can't get a function implemented correctly, its
implementation must at least build successfully.  For example, if you
don't have time to correctly implement <code>Map::erase</code> or
<code>Map::swap</code>, say, here are implementations that meet this
requirement in that they at least allow programs to build successfully
even though they might execute incorrectly:
</p>
<pre>
        bool Map::erase(const KeyType&amp; value)
        {
            return true;  // not correct, but at least this compiles
        }

        void Map::swap(Map&amp; other)
        {
            // does nothing; not correct, but at least this compiles
        }
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Given <code>Map.h</code> with the type alias for the Map's key type specifying
<code>std::string</code> and the type alias for its value type specifying
<code>double</code>, if we make no change to your <code>Map.cpp</code>,
then if we compile your <code>Map.cpp</code> and link it to a file containing

During execution, your program must not perform any undefined actions, such

Notice that we are not requiring any particular content in
<code>testMap.cpp</code>, <code>testCarMap.cpp</code>, and
<code>testnewMap.cpp</code>, as long as they meet the requirements above.
Of course, the intention is that you'd use those files for the test code that
you'd write to convince yourself that your implementations are correct.
Although we will throughly evaluate your implementations for correctness,
for homeworks, unlike for projects, we will not grade the thoroughness of
your test cases.  Incidentally, for homeworks, unlike for projects, we will
also not grade your program commenting.
