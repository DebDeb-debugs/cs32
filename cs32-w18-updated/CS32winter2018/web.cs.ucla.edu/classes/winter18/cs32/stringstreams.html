<h2>Stringstreams</h2>
</div>
<p>
Sometimes you have information that you would like to present in a way that
would be trivial if it were delivered to the screen using <code>cout</code>.
For example, suppose we want to write a double in the conventional way of
representing a U.S. monetary amount:
</p>
<pre>
	double amt;
	... <em>suppose some code here gives </em>amt<em> the value</em> 123.4
	cout.setf(ios::fixed);
	cout.precision(2);
	cout &lt;&lt; "$" &lt;&lt; amt;
</pre>
<p>
(The middle two statements set the state of <code>cout</code> so that all
doubles written from now on will be in fixed instead of scientific notation,
and will display two digits to the right of the decimal point.)
</p><p>
But suppose instead that we didn't want to write the sequence of characters
"$123.40" to the screen, but instead wanted to capture it into a string
that we could do something with later.  Here's an easy way to do this:
</p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;iostream> // defines the overloads of the &lt;&lt; operator
	#include &lt;sstream>  // defines the type std::ostringstream
	using namespace std;

	...
	double amt;
	... <em>suppose some code here gives </em>amt<em> the value</em> 123.4
	ostringstream oss;  // oss is a name of our choosing.
	oss.setf(ios::fixed);
	oss.precision(2);
	oss &lt;&lt; "$" &lt;&lt; amt;  // puts "$123.40" in oss's internal storage
	string s = oss.str();  // s gets "$123.40"
</pre>
<p>
The type name <code>ostringstream</code> denotes an <em>output
stringstream</em>.  We created one that we chose to call <code>oss</code>.
Just as an output stream like <code>cout</code> uses the screen as
destination for characters, and an <code>ofstream</code> (an output file
stream) uses a file as a destination for characters, an
<code>ostringstream</code> uses its own internal storage as a destination for
characters.  You can later retrieve those characters as a string.
</p><p>
When we created <code>oss</code>, its internal storage is empty.  The
operations we can perform on an <code>ostringstream</code> are the same
ones we can perform on <code>cout</code> or an <code>ofstream</code>.
To retrieve the characters later as a <code>string</code>, use the
<code>ostringstream</code>'s member function <code>str()</code>.  Here's
another example:
</p>
<pre>
	#include &lt;iostream> // defines the overloads of the &lt;&lt; operator
	#include &lt;sstream>  // defines the type std::ostringstream
	#include &lt;iomanip>  // defines the manipulator setw
	using namespace std;

	...
	ostringstream oss;
	oss &lt;&lt; "-----\n";
	int k;
	... <em>suppose some code here gives </em>k<em> the value</em> 123
	oss &lt;&lt; setw(5) &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; endl;
	string s = oss.str();
</pre>
<p>
The string <code>s</code> now contains <code>"-----\n&nbsp;&nbsp;123\n"</code>.
(The <code>setw(5)</code> says that the next thing written (a number or a
string) will be written in a field 5 characters wide, so there are two
spaces before the <code>123</code>.)  Notice that we don't have to write
everything to the <code>ostringstream</code> at one time; we can write
something, then later on something additional, etc. This can make it
easier to use than the C library's <code>sprintf</code> function.
</p><p>
Suppose we're writing a value in a field wider than we need to represent the
value (e.g., writing 123 in a field more than 3 characters wide).  By default,
the extra characters will be blanks, but we can change that by setting the
stream's fill character:
</p>
<pre>
	ostringstream oss;
	int k;
	... <em>suppose some code here gives </em>k<em> the value</em> 123
	oss &lt;&lt; setw(5) &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; endl;
	oss.fill('*');
	oss &lt;&lt; setw(5) &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; endl;
	oss &lt;&lt; setw(4) &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; endl;
	oss.fill('0');
	oss &lt;&lt; setw(5) &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; endl;
	string s = oss.str();
</pre>
<p>
The string <code>s</code> now contains
<code>"&nbsp;&nbsp;123\n**123\n*123\n00123\n"</code>.
</p><p>
There is also the concept of an <em>input stringstream</em>, an
<code>istringstream</code>, but this isn't useful for Project 3.
