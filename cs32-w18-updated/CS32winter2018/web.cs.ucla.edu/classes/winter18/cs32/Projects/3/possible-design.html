 <title>CS 32 Project 3 Possible Design, Winter 2018</title>

<p>
Here is a possible design of the Actor inheritance hierarchy:
</p>
<pre>
GraphObject
    Actor
        Star
        Explosion
        DamageableObject
            Player
            Alien
                Smallgon
                Smoregon
                Snagglegon
        Projectile
            Cabbage
            Turnip
            Torpedo
                PlayerLaunchedTorpedo
                AlienLaunchedTorpedo
        Goodie
            ExtraLifeGoodie
            RepairGoodie
            TorpedoGoodie
</pre>
<p>
You are not obligated to follow this design, but you must take advantage
of inheritance to avoid large amounts of repetitive code.  The technique in
item 7 on p. 44 of the spec is especially helpful in reducing repetition.
For example, suppose you had code like this:
</p>
<pre>
	void RepairGoodie::doSomething()
	{
	    ...
	    <em>increase the player's hit points by 10</em>
	    ...
	}

	void TorpedoGoodie::doSomething()
	{
	    ...
	    <em>increase the player's number of torpedoes by 5</em>
	    ...
	}
</pre>
<p>
where the several lines omitted code is the same in the two functions.
You might avoid the repeated code by instead doing something like this:
</p>
<pre>
	void Goodie::doSomething()
	{
	   ...   <em>(same as the code in the first ... in each function)</em>
	   grantSpecificReward(<em>the player</em>);
	   ...   <em>(same as the code in the second ... in each function)</em>
	}

	void RepairGoodie::grantSpecificReward(Player* p)
	{
	    <em>increase the player's hit points by 10</em>
	}

	void TorpedoGoodie::grantSpecificReward(Player* p)
	{
	    <em>increase the player's number of torpedoes by 5</em>
	}
</pre>
<p>
where <code>grantSpecificReward</code> is declared pure virtual in Goodie.
This way, the subclasses of Goodie do not have to implement
<code>doSomething</code> at all; they can just inherit Goodie's implementation
and provide only the code that is specific to them.
</p>
