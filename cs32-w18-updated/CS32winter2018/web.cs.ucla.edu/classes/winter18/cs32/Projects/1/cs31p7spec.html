<h2>CS 31 Programming Assignment 7<br />
It's a Gas!</h2>
</div>
<p>
You have arrived in the walled city of Flatula, whose residents eat beans,
cabbage, and hard-boiled eggs with every meal.  Although they are used to
the resulting effects, the odor that emanates from the Flatulans you encounter
makes you woozy.  Your only hope to keep from passing out is to successfully
preach to the Flatulans about converting to a diet of lean meat, lettuce,
and rice.
</p>
<p>
That's the scenario for a new video game under development.  Your
assignment is to complete the prototype that uses character-based graphics.
</p>
<p>
If you execute <a href="gas.exe">this Windows program</a> or
<a href="gasmac.zip">this Mac program</a> or <a href="gas.html">this
Linux program</a>, you will see the player (indicated by <code>@</code>)
in a rectangular city filled with Flatulans (usually indicated by
<code>F</code>).  At each turn, the user will select an action for the
player to take.  The player will take the action, and then each Flatulan will
move one step in a random direction.  The attempt to move will make each
Flatulan break wind.  If the Flatulan is orthogonally adjacent to the player,
the player is affected by the blast of gas.  If the player suffers ten such
blasts during the game, the player passes out and the game is over.
</p>
<p>
This smaller <a href="minigas.exe">Windows version</a> or
<a href="minigasmac.zip">Mac version</a> or
<a href="minigas.html">Linux version</a> of the game may help you see
the operation of the game more clearly.
</p>
<p>
At each turn the player may take one of these actions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Move one step up, down, left, or right to an empty position (i.e., one not
occupied by a Flatulan).  If the player attempts to move into the wall of
the city (e.g., down, when on the bottom row) or to a position occupied by a
Flatulan, the player does not move.
</li>
<li>
Preach to the Flatulans adjacent to the player orthogonally or diagonally
(i.e., to any Flatulans next to the player in the eight directions).  For
each of those Flatulans, there is a 2/3 probability that the player will
convert that Flatulan to no longer pollute the air.  A Flatulan who has been
converted should be removed from the game, since they pose no further threat
to the player and are thus irrelevant.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The game allows the user to select the player's action by typing u/d/l/r for
moving or just hitting enter for preaching.  The user may also type q to
prematurely quit the game.
</p>
<p>
When it's the Flatulans' turn, each Flatulan picks a random direction (up,
down, left, or right) with equal probability.  The Flatulan moves one step
in that direction if it can; however, if doing so would cause the Flatulan
to move into a wall of the city (e.g., down, when on the bottom row) or to the
position occupied by the player, it does not move.  More than one Flatulan
may occupy the same position; in that case, instead of <code>F</code>, the
display will show a digit character indicating the number of Flatulans at
that position (where <code>9</code> indicates 9 or more).  After each
Flatulan attempts to move (even if it doesn't actually move), if it is now
orthogonally adjacent to the player (i.e., next to the player directly above,
below, to the left, or to the right), the player suffers one blast of gas
from that Flatulan.  If this is the tenth gas blast the player has suffered
during the game, the player passes out and the game is over.
</p>
<p>
The CS 31 assignment was to complete a C++ program skeleton to produce a
program that implements the described behavior.  For CS 32 Project 1, we
will give you a correct solution the the CS 31 assignment.  The program
defines four classes that represent the four kinds of objects this program
works with: Game, City, Flatulan, and Player.  Details of the interface to
these classes are in the program code, but here are the essential
responsibilities of each class:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><p>Game</p></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
To create a Game, you specify a number of rows and columns and the number
of Flatulans to start with.  The Game object creates an appropriately sized
City and populates it with the Player and the Flatulans.
</li>
<li>
A game may be played.  (Notice that the city is displayed after the Flatulans
have had their turn to move, but not after the player has had its turn.)
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><p>City</p></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
When an City object of a particular size is created, it has no Flatulans or
player.  In the City coordinate system, row 1, column 1 is the
upper-left-most position that can be occupied by a Flatulan or Player.  (If
an City were created with 7 rows and 8 columns, then the lower-right-most
position that could be occupied would be row 7, column 8.)
</li>
<li>
You may tell the City object to create or a Flatulan at a particular
position.
</li>
<li>
You may tell the City object to create a Player at a particular position.
</li>
<li>
You may tell the City object to have all the Flatulans in it make their move.
</li>
<li>
You may tell the City object that the Flatulans around the player are
being preached to.  Flatulans that are converted must be removed from the
City, since they serve no further purpose in the game.
</li>
<li>
You may ask the City object its size, how many Flatulans are at a particular
position, and how many Flatulans altogether are in the City.
</li>
<li>
You may ask the City object whether moving from a particular position in a
particular direction is possible (i.e., would not go off the edge of the
city), and if so, what the resulting position would be.
</li>
<li>
You may ask the City object for access to its player.
</li>
<li>
An City object may be displayed on the screen, showing the locations of the
Flatulans and player, along with other status information.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><p>Player</p></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
A Player is created at some position (using the City coordinate system, where
row 1, column 1 is the upper-left-most position, etc.).
</li>
<li>
You may tell a Player to preach or to move in a particular direction.
</li>
<li>
You may tell a Player it has suffered a gas blast.
</li>
<li>
You may ask a Player for its position, age (i.e., how many turns the player has
survived without passing out), and health status (i.e., how many more gas
blasts the player will cause the player to pass out).
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><p>Flatulan</p></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
A Flatulan is created at some position (using the City coordinate system, where
row 1, column 1 is the upper-left-most position, etc.).
</li>
<li>
You may tell a Flatulan to move.
</li>
<li>
You may ask a Flatulan object for its position.
</li>
<li>
You may tell a Flatulan object that it is being preached to, and find out
whether the Flatulan has been converted.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
CS 31 students were told:
</p>
<p>
Complete the implementation in accordance with the description of the game.
You are allowed to make whatever changes you want to the <em>private</em>
parts of the classes:  You may add or remove private data members or private
member functions, or change their types.  You must <em>not</em> make any
deletions, additions, or changes to the <em>public</em> interface of any
of these classes &mdash; we're depending on them staying the same so that
we can test your programs.  You can and will, of course, make changes to the
<em>implementations</em> of public member functions, since the callers of
the function wouldn't have to change any of the code they write to call
the function.  You must <strong>not</strong> declare any public data
members, nor use any global variables whose values may change during
execution (so global constants are OK).  You may add additional functions
that are not members of any class.  The word <code>friend</code> must not
appear in your program.
</p>
<p>
Any member functions you implement must never put an object into an
invalid state, one that will cause a problem later on.  (For example, bad
things could come from placing a Flatulan outside the city.)  Any function
that has a reasonable way of indicating failure through its return value
should do so.  Constructors pose a special difficulty because they can't
return a value.  If a constructor can't do its job, we have it write an error
message and exit the program with failure by calling <code>exit(1);</code>.
(We haven't learned about throwing an exception to signal constructor failure.)
