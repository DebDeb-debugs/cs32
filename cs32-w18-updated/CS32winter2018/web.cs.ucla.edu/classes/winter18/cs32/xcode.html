<h2>Xcode on a Mac</h2>
<p>
Here's how to install Xcode on a Mac and create and run a simple C++
program.  Xcode is an integrated development environment that uses the
clang++ compiler to compile your programs.
</p>
<h3>Installing Xcode</h3>
<p>
Xcode 9.2 is available only for macOS Sierra 10.12.6 or later.
Xcode 8.3.3 is available only for macOS Sierra 10.12 or later.  (Do
<em>not</em> install Xcode 8.3.1 or 8.3, which have a bug that will affect some
programs you'll write.)
XCode 8.2.1 is available only for OS X El Capitan 10.11.5 or later.
Xcode 7.3.1 is available only for OS X El Capitan 10.11 or later.
Xcode 7.2.1 is available for OS X El Capitan 10.11 and Yosemite 10.10.
Xcode can be downloaded for free from
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/downloads/</a>.
</p>
<h3>Creating an Xcode C++ Project</h3>
<p>
Xcode is designed to support developers of large systems, so to
use it as we will initially to write programs that are small by comparison
may seem like overkill.  However, over time you will come to appreciate some
features (the debugger, especially).
</p><p>
Here is a way to set up an Xcode project to compile and run a
simple three-file program.  A number of these steps may have alternate
ways to achieve the same end.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Start up the Xcode IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
</p></li>
<li><p>
Select File / New / Project....  You will be asked to choose a template
for your new project.  Select the macOS tab (or OS X), and in the Application
group, select Command Line Tool.  Click Next.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Pick a name for your project as the Product Name, such as "VoiceMail". 
For Organization Name, anything will do.  For Organization Identifier,
something simple like "cs32" is good.  For Language, select C++.  Click
Next.  
</p></li>
<li><p>
Select the folder in which you want your project folder to be created.  Click
Create.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
In the left frame, click once on the name <code>main.cpp</code> to open
the file, which already has some sample code in it.  Click once again on
the name to rename the file to what you want it to be, such as
<code>testVoiceMail.cpp</code>.  Click outside the text box to effect the
name change.  Replace the sample code in the edit frame with:
</p>
<pre>
	#include "VoiceMail.h"
	#include &lt;iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
	    VoiceMail vm;
	    vm.record("Call me back ASAP!");
	    vm.playback();
	    vm.erase();
	    vm.playback();
	    cout &lt;&lt; "End of VoiceMail test" &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>
In the left frame, right-click on the file folder icon with the name of
your project (above the name of the .cpp file), and select New File....
Select the macOS tab, and in the Source group, select C++ File.  Click
Next.  Use <code>VoiceMail</code> for the name and leave the box checked
for also creating a header file.  Click Next.  A save file dialog appears;
click Create.  This will add two files to your project: 
<code>VoiceMail.hpp</code> and <code>VoiceMail.cpp</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
In the left frame, click once on the name <code>VoiceMail.hpp</code> to open
the file, which already has some sample code in it.  Click once again on
the name to rename the file to <code>VoiceMail.h</code>, the more common
C++ convention.  Click outside the text box to effect the name change. 
Replace the sample code in the edit frame with:
</p>
<pre>
	  // VoiceMail interface

	#include &lt;string>

	class VoiceMail
	{
	  public:
	    void record(std::string msg);
	    void erase();
	    void playback() const;
	  private:
	    std::string m_message;
	};
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>
In the left frame, click on <code>VoiceMail.cpp</code> to open the file,
which already has a little code in it.  Replace that code with:
</p>
<pre>
	  // VoiceMail implementation

	#include "VoiceMail.h"
	#include &lt;string>
	#include &lt;iostream>
	using namespace std;

	void VoiceMail::record(string msg)
	{
	    m_message = msg;
	}

	void VoiceMail::erase()
	{
	    m_message = "";
	}

	void VoiceMail::playback() const
	{
	    if (m_message.empty())
		cout &lt;&lt; "There is no message to play back." &lt;&lt; endl;
	    else
		cout &lt;&lt; m_message &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>
From the main menu, select View / Debug Area / Activate Console.
</p></li>
<li><p>
In the upper left corner, click the Run right-facing triangle to build and
run your program.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If your program has any compilation or link errors, you'll be notified.
Click on the little red octagon icon near the top of the window to see the
errors. Fix the errors. Go back to step 10.
</p></li>
<li><p>
If your program built successfully, your output will appear in the Output
frame (bottom right below the edit frame).
</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Take heed</h3>
<p>
When running a program that takes input from the keyboard, don't type arrow
keys in the Output frame &mdash; they send strange characters to your
program and may even appear to reorder some of the characters delivered to
the program.
</p>
