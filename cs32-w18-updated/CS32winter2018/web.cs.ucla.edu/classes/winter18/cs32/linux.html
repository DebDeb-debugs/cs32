<h2>g++ with Linux</h2>
<p>
Every program you submit as source files must run successfully on the
SEASnet Linux server cs32.seas.ucla.edu using the g32 command we have set
up, which is merely a special way of running g++ that catches more kinds
of errors during execution.
</p><p>
What we're presenting here is a minimal set of instructions for helping a
Windows or Mac user transfer a C++ program to that SEASnet Linux server to
build and run.  There are other ways to do this than what we show; the
more you know about Linux, the more you can simplify or eliminate certain
steps.
</p><p>
Let's assume you have a Visual C++ or an Xcode project consisting of the
three source files from the <a href="visualcpp.html">Visual C++ 2017</a>
writeup or the <a href="xcode.html">Xcode on a Mac</a> writeup:
<code>VoiceMail.h</code>, <code>VoiceMail.cpp</code>, and
<code>testVoiceMail.cpp</code>.  (Note: It is inconvenient in Linux if the
name of a file contains space characters, so avoid giving your files such
names.)  Here's what to do to run the program on the SEASnet cs32 Linux
server:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
First, note that you will be able to log into that SEASnet Linux server only
from
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a machine on the UCLA campus network, or
</li><li>
the Windows-based remote
<a href="http://seasnet.ucla.edu/classes/seasnet-terminal-server"
target="_blank">SEASnet Terminal Server</a>; or
</li><li>
another machine (e.g., your own computer off-campus), provided you first
connect to the
<a href="https://www.it.ucla.edu/bol/services/virtual-private-network-vpn-clients"
target="_blank">campus VPN</a> (Virtual Private Network) server, which
makes it look like your machine is on the campus network.
</li>
</ul>
</li><li>
<p>
Create a zip file containing your three source files.  Let's suppose you
named the zip file <code>VM.zip</code>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
(Windows users) Put the zip file on your Windows desktop on a SEASnet machine.
Make sure you <em>copy</em> the file; don't just create a shortcut linking
to it.  Note: A few people each quarter find that step 7 below produces
produces the error message <code>unzip:  cannot find or open
Desktop/VM.zip, Desktop/VM.zip.zip or Desktop/VM.zip.ZIP.</code>  If that
happens to you, return to this step and copy your zip file to
<code>Z:\Desktop</code> or to
<code>\\labsamba2.seas.ucla.edu\<em>yourUserName</em>\Desktop</code> instead
of just dragging the file's icon to the desktop.
</p><p>
(Mac users) Put the zip file onto your desktop.  Launch the Terminal
application.  In Terminal, run the command <code>scp Desktop/VM.zip
<em>yourSEASaccount</em>@cs32.seas.ucla.edu:Desktop</code> and enter
your SEASnet account password when prompted.  This copies your file from
your Mac to the SEASnet cs32 Linux server.
</p><p>
If that command results in a scary warning about DNS spoofing, then run
the command <code>ssh <em>yourSEASaccount</em>@cs32.seas.ucla.edu
date</code> and answer yes to the question it asks.  Then try the
<code>scp</code> command again.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
(Windows users) From your Windows desktop on a SEASnet machine, double
click the icon labelled "Putty" (<strong>not</strong> "SSH LnxSrv").  Type
<code>cs32.seas.ucla.edu</code> for the Host Name in the dialog box. If a
dialog box titled "PuTTY Security Alert" appears, click its Yes button. 
In the PuTTY console window (titled something like "lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
- PuTTY"), log in to the Linux server with your SEASnet login name.  When
prompted for your password, type it in; the characters you type for your
password will not produce anything on the screen, not even bullets.
</p><p>
If there is no Putty icon, then double click on either "SSH LnxSrv" or
"SSH UGrad" or "SSH Grad".  Log in.  After you've typed your password,
then in response to the command prompt, type
<code>ssh <em>yourSEASaccount</em>@cs32.seas.ucla.edu</code> and your
password again when prompted.
</p><p>
(Mac users) From the Terminal application, run the command <code>ssh
<em>yourSEASaccount</em>@cs32.seas.ucla.edu</code> and enter your SEASnet
account password when prompted.  This logs you into the Linux server. 
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
You will now be interacting with the command interpreter program (the
<em>shell</em>), whose default prompt is something like
<code>bash-4.4$</code> or <code>[<em>yourname</em>@lnxsrv07 ~]$</code>. 
For each command you type, the shell will execute it and then prompt you
for the next command.  The shell is case-sensitive, so pay attention to
the distinction between lower and upper case.
</p><p>
About two or three people per quarter discover that a mistake was made when
their SEASnet account was set up.  To verify you're not one of them, run the
following command to list the contents of your desktop:
</p>
<pre>
	ls Desktop
</pre>
<p>
If it produces the output <code>ls: cannot access Desktop: No such file or
directory</code>, or if it does not show the name of the zip file you put
on your desktop (e.g., <code>VM.zip</code>), then either you did not follow
these instructions correctly or you are one of the rare people whose
SEASnet account setup wasn't done quite right.  In the latter case, contact
the SEASnet Help Desk in Boelter 2684 or at help@seas.ucla.edu; don't do so
in the former case, or you'll be wasting their time with your foolishness.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Our special way of running g++ is via a new command, g32, which you will have
to set up.  If you have never previously run the following command, run it
now; you will never have to run it again.  If you do run it again, it will
confirm that you are set up for running g32 on the SEASnet Linux server.
</p>
<pre>
	curl -s -L http://cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter18/cs32/Utilities/setupg32 | bash
</pre>
</li><li>
<p>
Unbundle the zip file into its own directory called, say, <code>proj0</code>:
</p>
<pre>
	unzip -j -a -d proj0 Desktop/VM.zip
</pre>
</li><li>
<p>
Make <code>proj0</code> the <em>current directory</em> (i.e., the default
directory for now in which files will be found or created):
</p>
<pre>
	cd proj0
</pre>
<p>
Like many Linux commands, if this command works, it doesn't say anything, so
the shell would then just print its next prompt.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Verify that the expected three files are present by listing the contents of
the current directory:
</p>
<pre>
	ls
</pre>
<p>
File names in Linux are case-sensitive.  You'll have a problem if one of
your .cpp files says <code>#include "VoiceMail.h"</code> but the
.h file is named <code>voicemail.h</code>.  You could use the
move command to change the name of the file:
</p>
<pre>
	mv voicemail.h VoiceMail.h
</pre>
</li><li>
<p>
Build an executable file from the source files.  If we would like the
executable file to be named <code>vm</code>, we'd say
</p>
<pre>
	g32 -o vm *.cpp
</pre>
<p>
The <code>*.cpp</code> saves us typing individual file names by matching
all the files whose names end in <code>.cpp</code>.  Notice that we do not
list any <code>.h</code> files.
(You don't have to know this, but the setup process in step 6 modified the
file <code>~/.profile</code> to create a bash function that causes the
above command to be executed as if it were <code>/usr/local/cs/bin/g++
-std=c++14 -Wall -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare -Werror=return-type 
-Wl,--rpath=/usr/local/cs/lib64 -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=undefined
-fsanitize=bounds -fno-omit-frame-pointer -o vm *.cpp</code> instead.  The
<code>/usr/local/cs/bin/g++</code>
invokes g++ version 7.2.0; the SEASnet server's default is version 4.8.5. 
The <code>-std=c++14</code> enables C++14 language features.  The
<code>-Wall</code> option asks the compiler to warn you about many
questionable constructs; the <code>-Wextra -Wno-sign-compare</code> asks
for warnings about even more questionable constructs.  The
<code>-Werror=return-type</code> causes a certain warning to be treated as
an error.  The other added options cause certain runtime errors to
terminate your program with an error message instead of silently
continuing and wreaking havoc.)
</p><p>
Compiler diagnostic messages are of the form
</p>
<pre>
	<em>fileName</em>:<em>lineNumber</em>:<em>columnNumber</em>:<em>message</em>
</pre>
<p>
If the compiler detects any problems that you want to fix, then since we're
assuming you're doing your primary development using Visual C++ or Xcode,
you should make changes to your original Windows or Mac files.  After
checking in Visual C++ or Xcode that the modified program works as you
expect it to, go back to step 1.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
To execute the program <code>vm</code> that you built, you'd just say
</p>
<pre>
	vm
</pre>
<p>
(If that doesn't work, try
</p>
<pre>
	./vm
</pre>
<p>
instead.)
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
To exit the shell, say
</p>
<pre>
	exit
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you want to examine a file under Linux, a simple text editor you can use is
Nano.
<pre>
	nano testVoiceMail.cpp
</pre>
You can navigate with the arrow keys.  The bottom two lines of the display
show you some commands you can type.  For example, control-C (indicated in
the bottom display as <code>^C</code>) shows you what line number the cursor
is on.  Control-O saves any changes you make to the file, and control-X exits
the editor.
</p><p>
We strongly recommend that you don't test your program using g32 just once,
only after you're satisfied with it under Visual C++ or Xcode.  Instead, do it
periodically during your development, and certainly do it when you're trying
to find an elusive bug.  Sometimes people have spent hours trying to track
down a problem during execution using Visual C++ when the g32 command
would have immediately given them a warning that pointed to the mistake.
Also, sometimes a program that appeared to work correctly under Visual C++
or Xcode relied on undefined behavior, but happened to get lucky for the
student in a way that wasn't reproduced when we tested the program;
testing using g32 might have shown different behavior, which would have
suggested to the student that something was amiss.
