 <title>Running in Release Mode in Visual C++</title>

<h2>Running in Release mode in Visual C++</h2>
<p>
To speed up your program, you can build your program in the Release
configuration instead of the Debug configuration.  Programs built in the
Release configuration run much faster than in the Debug configuration, but
you lose the ability to get much information from the debugger if you're
using it to track down a bug.  (You can always switch the configuration
back from Release to Debug if you like.)  Here's what you do in Visual C++:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
In the source file that contains the main routine, add these lines at the
top of the file, outside of any function or class:
</p>
<pre>
	#if defined(_MSC_VER)  &&  !defined(_DEBUG)
	#include &lt;iostream>
	#include &lt;windows.h>
	#include &lt;conio.h>

	struct KeepWindowOpenUntilDismissed
	{
	    ~KeepWindowOpenUntilDismissed()
	    {
	        DWORD pids[1];
	        if (GetConsoleProcessList(pids, 1) == 1)
	        {
	            std::cout &lt;&lt; "Press any key to continue . . . ";
	            _getch();
	        }
	    }
	} keepWindowOpenUntilDismissed;
	#endif
</pre>
<p>
There is no need to remove these lines even if you go back to running in
Debug mode or you run under g32 or clang++.  You may leave them in a program
you turn in.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In the <strong>Build</strong> menu, select <strong>Configuration
Manager</strong>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In the drop-down list under <strong>Active Solution Configuration</strong>,
select <strong>Release</strong> instead of <strong>Debug</strong>, and then
close that dialog.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</body>
