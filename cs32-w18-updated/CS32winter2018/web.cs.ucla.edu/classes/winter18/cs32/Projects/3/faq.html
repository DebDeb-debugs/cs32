<h2>Project 3 FAQ</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>How can I get started writing code?</strong>
</p><p>
Start with this task:  Re-read the spec, paying attention only to mentions
of stars.  Implement a field of 30 stars that don't move.  This can be
done in about five lines of StudentWorld code and five lines of Actor
code.  Once you do this, you'll be surprised at what a psychological boost
it is to see the graphics on the screen.  With three more lines of code,
you can get the stars to drift left (although they continue to drift
off-screen or bunch up at the left, depending on your implementation). 
Fewer than twenty more lines of code gets rid of those that move
off-screen, with no memory leaks.  (The <a href="warmup.html">Project 3
warmup</a> is useful for that.)  Add two more lines of code to introduce
new stars, and you have a continuously drifting star field.  You're done
with stars!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>How do I generate random numbers?</strong>
</p><p>
GameConstants.h has a function <code>int randInt(int min, int max)</code>
that returns a random int in the range [min, max].
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>May we use <code>protected</code> members?</strong>
</p><p>
You must not use protected <em>data</em> members.  You may use protected member
<em>functions</em> if you wish.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>May we use <code>friend</code>?</strong>
</p><p>
No.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Suppose that while calling <em>doSomething()</em> for each actor during
a given tick, we create a new actor.  Must we call <em>doSomething()</em> for
the new actor on the current tick?</strong>
</p><p>
It's you choice whether or not you do.  Of course, on the next tick,
<em>doSomething()</em> will be called on all actors including that new one.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Suppose there's a requirement about an interaction between an
object of type A (e.g., a Smallgon) and an object of type B (e.g., a
cabbage).  If the spec says that the A object has to manage that
interaction or that both the A and the B objects have to manage it, but I
find it more convenient to have the only the B object manage it, is it
acceptable to have the only the B object manage it if the result is
essentially the same?
</strong>
</p><p>
Yes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>As part of writing <em>a high-level description of each of your public
member functions</em> (spec p. 50), do we have to write pseudocode?
</strong>
</p><p>
Only for the more complex functions, of which there are probably comparatively
few.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
<p>
Why is a program compiled with g32 giving me a runtime error like this?
</p>
<pre>
	Actor.cpp:<em>lineNum</em>:&hellip;: runtime error: member call on address &hellip;
	which does not point to an object of type '<em>someType</em>'
	&hellip;: note: object has invalid vptr
</pre>
</strong>
<p>
A derived class constructor (at the indicated line number) is calling a
function implemented in the derived or base class before the base class
constructor has even been called.  As far as the compiler knows, this could
be dangerous, since the base object and the data members of the derived
object have not yet been initialized &mdash; what if the function depends
on their values?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Could you please tell me a story about type casting?
</strong>
<p>
Sure.  Suppose we have the following class hierarchy:
</p>
<pre>
	class Shape { ... };  // no fill function
	class LineSegment : public Shape { ... } // no fill function
	class Arc : public Shape { ... } // no fill function
	class ClosedFigure : public Shape
	{...
	    virtual void fill(Color c) = 0;
	};
	class Circle : public ClosedFigure
	{...
	    virtual void fill(Color c) { ... }
	};
	class Rectangle : public ClosedFigure
	{...
	    virtual void fill(Color c) { ... }
	};

	Shape* f() { ... }
</pre>
<p>
Only shapes that enclose an area can be filled with a color; you can't fill
the nonexistent interior of a line segment or an arc, but you can fill a
closed figure like a circle or a rectangle.
</p><p>
Suppose we call f, and the circumstances of the call are such that we
<em>know</em> with certainty that for this particular call of f, the Shape*
that it returns is a pointer to the Shape part of a Circle.  We'd like to
fill that circle.  Here's what <em>won't</em> work:
</p>
<pre>
	Shape* sp = f();  // Suppose f() returns a pointer to the Shape part of a Circle
	sp->fill(RED);  // Error!  Shape did not declare fill.

	Circle* cp = f();  // Error!  No automatic conversion from Shape* to Circle*
	rp->fill(RED);

	ClosedFigure* cfp = f();  // Error!  No automatic conversion from Shape* to ClosedFigure*
	cfp->fill(RED);
</pre>
<p>
Although the conversion from a Derived* to a Base* (an <em>upcast</em>) is
automatic, we have to explicitly ask for a conversion from a Base* to a
Derived* (a <em>downcast</em>).  Using <code>static_cast</code>, we had
better be right:  The behavior is undefined if the Base* doesn't actually
point to a Derived object of the that type.
</p>
<pre>
	Shape* sp = f();  // Suppose f() returns a pointer to the Shape part of a Circle
	Circle* cp = static_cast&lt;Circle*>(sp);
	cp->fill(RED);

	ClosedFigure* cfp = static_cast&lt;ClosedFigure*>(sp);
	cfp->fill(RED);

	static_cast&lt;Circle*>(sp)->fill(RED);
	static_cast&lt;ClosedFigure*>(sp)->fill(RED);

	Rectangle* rp = static_cast&lt;Rectangle*>(sp);  // Undefined behavior!
	rp->fill(RED);
</pre>
<p>
For most compilers, the undefined behavior shows up as the call to fill doing
something weird or crashing.  Code compiled with g32 will report the bad
downcast itself as a runtime error.
</p>
